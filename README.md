## Instruction on running the Script [keyword.py](scripts/search/keywords.py) for search purpose (key word mapping on target attribute)

- Modify the [conditions](scripts/search/keywords.py#L37) based on your need
- Run the script

Example Query:
```python
# conditions
keywords = {'how far are we'}
attribute = 'title'
display_attributes = ['title', 'url', 'venue_name', 'venue_type', 'year']
yrs_range = [str(i) for i in range(2017, 2023)]

```

Example Output:
